# ðŸ“ˆ SDE Visualizer â€” Blackâ€“Scholes & Heston

An interactive **Streamlit** app to explore stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in finance.  
The tool demonstrates the **Blackâ€“Scholes (GBM)** and **Heston** models through simulations, performance benchmarks, and volatility smile analysis using real AAPL option data.  

This project was developed as part of my MSc thesis *"Stochastic Differential Equations and their Applications in Finance"*.
